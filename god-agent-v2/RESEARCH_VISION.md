# Latent Space Extraction: A Research Vision for Autonomous Simulation Generation

## Abstract

We propose a novel paradigm for extracting stateful, interactive simulations from Large Language Models (LLMs) through autonomous Entity Component System (ECS) generation. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs contain latent representations of complex systems that can be materialized into executable, inspectable, and modifiable simulations through tool-augmented autonomous agents. This work has implications for computational modeling, AI interpretability, scientific simulation, and the future of human-AI collaboration in research.

## 1. Introduction and Approach

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

Large Language Models, trained on vast corpora of human knowledge, contain compressed representations of complex systems, scientific phenomena, and behavioral patterns. These "latent simulations" can be extracted and materialized into executable code through autonomous agents equipped with appropriate tools and architectural frameworks.

### 1.2 Methodology

Our system employs:
- **Autonomous Tool-Using Agents**: LLMs equipped with domain-specific tools for ECS creation
- **Entity Component System Architecture**: Data-oriented design enabling flexible, inspectable simulations
- **Natural Language Interfaces**: Direct translation from research questions to executable models
- **Iterative Refinement**: Agents that can modify and extend simulations based on feedback

### 1.3 Technical Innovation

Unlike traditional simulation frameworks that require explicit programming, our approach enables:
- **Zero-Code Simulation Generation**: Natural language → executable models
- **Compositional Modeling**: Automatic combination of disparate systems
- **Real-Time Introspection**: Every entity, component, and relationship is queryable
- **Autonomous Validation**: Self-testing and verification of generated models
