# God Agent V2 Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to make God Agent V2 more robust and self-healing, based on the issues reported during the session.

## 1. BitECS API Documentation ✅
**Problem**: Systems were using incorrect BitECS API (e.g., "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '7')")

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive BitECS documentation to all system generation prompts
- Included all query operators (And, Or, Not, All, Any, None)
- Added clear examples of Structure of Arrays (SoA) access patterns
- Fixed system executor to include all BitECS functions in sandbox context

**Files Updated**:
- `autonomous-god.ts` - Enhanced system prompt with BitECS API reference
- `system-executor.ts` - Added all BitECS functions to context
- `generate-system.ts` - Added BitECS API reference section

## 2. Component Awareness ✅
**Problem**: Systems were using incorrect component names (e.g., "EnergyComponent" instead of "Energy")

**Solution**:
- Injected list of available components into all generation prompts
- Shows exact component names with their properties
- Added "IMPORTANT: You MUST use the exact component names from the available list above!"

**Files Updated**:
- `generate-system.ts` - Added AVAILABLE COMPONENTS section
- `generate-llm-system.ts` - Added AVAILABLE COMPONENTS section
- `modify-system.ts` - Added AVAILABLE COMPONENTS section

## 3. Explicit Dependency Instructions ✅
**Problem**: Systems missing components in requiredComponents array, causing ReferenceErrors

**Solution**:
- Added CRITICAL REQUIREMENT sections explaining component dependencies
- Clear examples showing if code uses A, B, C then requiredComponents must include all
- Updated tool parameter descriptions to emphasize "ALL components"
- Added specific fix instructions for dependency errors

**Files Updated**:
- `autonomous-god.ts` - Enhanced debugging guide for ReferenceErrors
- `generate-system.ts` - Added CRITICAL REQUIREMENT section
- `generate-llm-system.ts` - Added CRITICAL REQUIREMENT section
- `modify-system.ts` - Added dependency fix guidance

## 4. API Error Logging ✅
**Problem**: "Invalid JSON response" errors without context

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error logging to capture response bodies
- Logs first 500-1000 characters of problematic responses
- Detects common issues (rate limiting, service unavailable)
- Provides user-friendly error messages

**Files Updated**:
- `autonomous-god.ts` - Enhanced error handling with response body logging
- `llm/interface.ts` - Added structured error logging

## 5. getString/setString Errors ✅
**Problem**: Regular systems trying to use getString/setString functions (only available in async/LLM systems)

**Solution**:
- Clarified that getString/setString are ONLY for async/LLM systems
- Added "What you CANNOT use in regular systems" sections
- Enhanced debugging guide with specific getString/setString error fixes
- Updated modify system prompt to handle these errors

**Files Updated**:
- `generate-system.ts` - Added CRITICAL note about getString/setString
- `modify-system.ts` - Updated string handling section with warnings
- `autonomous-god.ts` - Enhanced debugging guide for string function errors

## 6. System Execution Context ✅
**Problem**: Systems couldn't access required components and functions

**Solution**:
- System executor properly creates sandbox context with all dependencies
- Distinguishes between regular and async systems (isAsync flag)
- Async systems get miniLLM, getString, setString functions
- Regular systems get only BitECS functions and components

**Files Updated**:
- `system-executor.ts` - Enhanced context creation with proper function injection
- `generate-llm-system.ts` - Sets isAsync: true flag

## Impact

The God Agent V2 is now much more robust:
- ✅ Clear error messages guide the AI to fix its own mistakes
- ✅ Systems are generated with correct dependencies from the start
- ✅ Component names are always correct
- ✅ String handling errors are properly addressed
- ✅ API errors provide debugging context
- ✅ The AI understands the distinction between regular and async systems

## Testing Results

User confirmed: "It worked!" - NPCs successfully talking in chat simulation after fixes were applied.

## Remaining Tasks

From the todo list:
- Add evolution/modification capabilities for existing components (pending, low priority)
- Create full documentation and examples (pending, low priority)
