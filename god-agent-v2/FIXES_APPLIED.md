# Fixes Applied Based on AI Review

## üéØ Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Enhanced System Prompt with Critical Execution Rules
**Problem**: The LLM was making incorrect assumptions about the execution environment
**Fix**: Added explicit rules to the system prompt explaining:
- System sandbox limitations
- Component dependency requirements
- No JSON comments allowed
- Agent vs System capabilities
- Component property validation

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed JSON Parser to Handle Comments
**Problem**: LLM was generating JSON with `//` comments causing parse errors
**Fix**: Updated `parseJSON()` to strip both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments

### 3. ‚úÖ Improved Error Propagation
**Problem**: Async system errors weren't being properly stored for God to fix
**Fix**: Modified error handlers to re-throw errors so they bubble up to `executeSystem` where they're logged

### 4. ‚úÖ Already Had checkSystemErrors Tool
**Good News**: The suggested tool already exists and properly finds system errors!

## üöÄ What This Means

Now when you run God Agent:

1. **Fewer ReferenceErrors** - God will know to include all components in `requiredComponents`
2. **No More JSON Parse Errors** - Comments will be stripped automatically
3. **Better Self-Healing** - All errors are captured and God can fix them
4. **Clearer Guidance** - God understands the sandbox constraints

## üìù Next Steps for Users

1. **Restart God Agent** to load the new prompts
2. **Ask God to check and fix errors**: 
   ```
   Check for system errors and fix them
   ```
3. **Try creating something new** - it should work much better!

## üé® Example Commands That Should Work Better

```
# Simple particle system
Create 5 bouncing particles with physics and collision detection

# Text adventure 
Build a text adventure with 3 rooms where I can move between them

# Neural network
Create a neural network with 10 neurons that form connections

# Then generate UI
Generate a beautiful interactive UI for my simulation
```

The key insight from the review was that these weren't architecture problems - they were context and communication problems. The architecture is solid; we just needed to teach the AI about its constraints!
