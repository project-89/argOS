# Runtime Fixes Summary 

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ BitECS API Errors
- Added comprehensive BitECS API documentation to system prompts
- Fixed "world.query is not a function" by providing correct API in sandbox
- Enhanced system context with ALL BitECS functions

### 2. ✅ String Component Errors  
- Fixed "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'X')" errors
- Properly integrated string storage utilities from god-components
- Updated getString/setString to work with component arrays

### 3. ✅ Component Dependencies
- Enhanced error messages to identify missing dependencies
- Added `newRequiredComponents` parameter for fixing dependencies
- Clear guidance on declaring all used components

## The Complete Fix

### System Executor Updates
```typescript
// Now includes in sandbox:
- query, addEntity, removeEntity, addComponent, removeComponent
- hasComponent, entityExists  
- And, Or, Not, All, Any, None (query operators)
- Wildcard support for relations
- Proper getString/setString implementations
```

### String Handling
```javascript
// Correct usage in systems:
setString(Message.content, eid, "Hello world");
const text = getString(Message.content, eid);

// NOT:
Message.content[eid] = "Hello"; // Wrong!
```

### Dependency Declaration
```javascript
// System must declare ALL components it uses:
generateSystem({
  name: "ChatSystem",
  requiredComponents: ["Player", "InRoom", "ChatMessage"], // ALL of them!
  // ...
});
```

## Expected Results

With these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ No more "Cannot set properties of undefined" errors
- ✅ No more "world.query is not a function" errors  
- ✅ Systems execute successfully with string components
- ✅ God agent can self-diagnose and fix dependency issues

## Testing

1. **Start fresh**: `/clear`
2. **Create test**: "Create a chat room with NPCs that send messages"
3. **Verify**: Systems should run without the previous errors
4. **Self-heal**: If errors occur, "Check for system errors and fix them"

The runtime is now much more robust and can handle complex simulations with string data, relationships, and proper BitECS API usage!
