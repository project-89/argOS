# Runtime Error Fixes

## Errors Fixed

### 1. TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
**Location**: `god-components.ts:102` in `hashString` function

**Cause**: The AI was calling `setString` with undefined or null values, and the `hashString` function wasn't handling these cases.

**Fix**: 
- Added null/undefined checks in both `storeString` and `hashString` functions
- Return 0 as the hash for null/undefined/empty strings
- Added String() conversion to ensure values are strings

### 2. ReferenceError: fix is not defined
**Location**: `modify-system.ts:145`

**Cause**: The code was still using `fix.changes` from the structured output implementation, but the variable was named `result` in the current code.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `fix.changes` to `result.changes`

### 3. setString receiving undefined values
**Location**: `system-executor.ts:122`

**Cause**: Systems were passing undefined values to setString, causing the hash function to fail.

**Fix**:
- Added value sanitization in the setString context function
- Convert null/undefined to empty string before hashing

### 4. Code validation too strict on "process"
**Location**: `llm/interface.ts:192`

**Cause**: The validation was rejecting any code containing the word "process", even in comments or variable names.

**Fix**:
- Changed pattern from `/\bprocess\b/` to `/\bprocess\.[a-zA-Z]/`
- Now only matches dangerous `process.something` patterns, not the word itself

## Impact

These fixes address:
- ✅ Systems can now safely handle null/undefined string values
- ✅ The modify-system action works correctly
- ✅ Generated code with the word "process" in comments won't be rejected
- ✅ More robust error handling throughout the string storage system

## Testing

The errors shown in the logs should now be resolved:
- No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- No more "fix is not defined" errors
- Systems with comments about "processing" entities will validate correctly
