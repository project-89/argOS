# God Agent V2 - Current Status

## üéâ What's Working

### Core Features
- **Dynamic ECS Generation**: God can create components, systems, and entities from natural language
- **LLM-Powered Systems**: Systems can use AI to make decisions (NPCs with consciousness)
- **Self-Healing**: God can detect and fix broken systems automatically
- **Web Visualization**: Universal visualizer adapts to any simulation type
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: God creates custom interfaces using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- **Multiple AI Models**: Support for all Gemini models including blazing fast Flash Lite
- **Persistence**: Save/load simulations as .godsim files

### Recent Successes
1. **Neuron Simulation**: Successfully created neurons that fire when threshold is reached
2. **Custom UI Generation**: God can generate artistic, interactive UIs for simulations
3. **Live Mode**: Systems run continuously in the background at configurable FPS
4. **Error Recovery**: God works around missing parameters and fixes issues

## üêõ Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Parameter Validation**: AI sometimes misses required parameters (e.g., `description` for createEntity)
   - **Workaround**: God successfully works around this by retrying

2. **System Errors**: Some generated systems have runtime errors accessing undefined properties
   - **Solution**: Use the `modifySystem` tool to fix errors when detected

3. **TypeScript Errors**: A few remaining type errors in CLI
   - **Impact**: Minimal - doesn't affect functionality

## üöÄ How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
# Main command - starts God with web visualization on port 8081
npm run run

# Then open: http://localhost:8081
```

### Example Commands
```bash
# Simple particle system
Create 5 bouncing particles with physics

# With custom UI
Create a particle system and generate a beautiful UI with glowing trails

# Social simulation
Build a chat room with 3 NPCs that talk to each other

# Neural network
Simulate 10 neurons forming a simple neural network

# Text adventure
Create a text adventure game with 3 rooms and a hero
```

## üé® Architecture Highlights

### Meta-Cognitive Design
```
God Agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro) 
  ‚Üí Creates Systems
    ‚Üí Systems can use LLMs (Gemini Flash)
      ‚Üí Entities gain AI consciousness
```

### Universal Visualization
- Adapts to any simulation type (spatial, social, narrative, abstract)
- Custom UI generation with HTML/CSS/JS
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Works with any component structure

### Self-Healing Capability
1. Systems track errors
2. God can check for errors
3. God modifies broken systems
4. Simulation continues running

## üìù Next Steps

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript errors for clean build
- [ ] Improve error messages for better debugging
- [ ] Add more example simulations

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add evolution/modification for existing components
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add more visualization styles

## üåü Cool Demos to Try

1. **Living Neural Network**
   ```
   Create a neural network with 10 neurons that form connections and learn patterns
   ```

2. **Ecosystem Simulation**
   ```
   Build an ecosystem with plants, herbivores, and predators that evolve over time
   ```

3. **AI Village**
   ```
   Create a village with 5 NPCs that have personalities and can talk to each other
   ```

4. **Physics Playground**
   ```
   Make bouncing balls with gravity and collision detection, then generate a game UI
   ```

Enjoy creating! The God Agent is ready to bring your simulations to life! üöÄ
