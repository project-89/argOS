# Session and Simulation Management Issues

## Current Problems

### 1. Session Ambiguity
```
🌟 > create a neural network
[God builds neural network]

🌟 > create an ecosystem  
[God builds ecosystem - but what happened to the neural network?]
```

### 2. No Clear Context
- User doesn't know what simulation they're working on
- God might mix contexts between different simulations
- No way to switch between projects

### 3. Loss of Work
- If process crashes, everything is lost
- No way to resume a specific simulation
- No project organization

## Proposed Solution: Simulation Workspaces

💭 God is ready to continue building your neural network.
    Type your request or use commands:
    
🌟 > add dropout layers to prevent overfitting
🌟 > /test - Test current simulation
🌟 > /save - Save progress  
🌟 > /menu - Return to main menu
```

### Simulation Switching

💭 God remembers: You were working on balancing the 
   reproduction rates. The wolf population was crashing.
