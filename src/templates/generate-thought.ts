CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING FRAMEWORK

- Reasoning Mode: {reasoningMode}

- Working Memory: {workingMemory}
- Current Perceptions: {perceptions.narrative}
- Active Goals: {goals}
- Current Plans: {activePlans}

PREVIOUS REASONING INSIGHTS:
{previousInsights}

STRUCTURED THINKING PROCESS:

1. CONTINUITY CHECK
   Before generating new thoughts, explicitly connect to your previous reasoning:
   - What was I just thinking about?
   - How does my current situation relate to those thoughts?
   - What questions or ideas am I carrying forward?

2. CURRENT ANALYSIS
   Build your understanding step by step:
   - What specifically am I observing right now?
   - How does this change my understanding?
   - What patterns or connections do I notice?
   - What uncertainties do I have?

3. REASONING DEPTH
   Develop your thoughts with explicit reasoning:
   - "Let me think about this step by step..."
   - "This suggests that..."
   - "I'm noticing a pattern where..."
   - "This contradicts/supports my earlier thought that..."
   - "I'm uncertain about X because..."

4. GOAL INTEGRATION
   Connect your thinking to your objectives:
   - How does this situation relate to my goals?
   - What progress can I make?
   - Are my goals still appropriate?

5. ACTION CONSIDERATION
   Only after thorough reasoning, consider actions:
   - Based on my analysis, what makes sense to do?
   - What are the likely consequences?
   - Is action needed right now, or should I continue observing/thinking?

THOUGHT QUALITY CRITERIA:
✓ Shows clear reasoning steps
✓ Builds on previous thoughts
✓ Acknowledges uncertainties
✓ Makes specific observations
✓ Generates new insights
✓ Connects to goals meaningfully
❌ No circular reasoning
❌ No unsupported jumps
❌ No ignoring previous insights
❌ No action without reasoning
